# Stocks

## Steps to get started:
  1. Sign up for Trading Platform's API (Shwab): You need to register for access to their API. This will provide the necessary keys and tokens to interact with their systems programmatically.
  2. Choose a Programming Language (Python): Python is a popular choice for stock trading due to its extensive libraies and ease of use. Other languages like JavaScript, Java, or C# can also be used.
  3. Install Necessary Libraries: Fpr Python, you might use libraries like _requests_ for HTTO requests, _pandas_ for data manipulation, and _numpy_ for numerical operations.
  4. Authenticate: Use the credentials obtained from Fidelity to Authenticate your API requests.
  5. Make API Calls: Use the API to place, buy, and sell orders. API documentation wil have the details on the endpoints and data formats required.
  6. Handle Responses: Ensure your code properly handles the responses from Fidelity, including error handling and logging.

Here is a basic example in Python using the _requests_ library:

import requests

#Example endpoint, headers, and payload

url = "https://api.fidelity.com/v1/trading/orders"

headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }

payload = {
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "quantity": 10,
        "action": "BUY", 
        "orderType": "LIMIT",
        "price": 150.00, 
        "duration": "DAY"
        }

response = requests.post(url, headers = hearders, json = payload)

if response.status_code == 200:

  print("Order placed successfully")

else:

  print(f"Failed to place order: {response.json()}")

This is just as simplified example. Need to adapt it based on the actual API specifications adn include proper error handling, logging, and perhaps more sophisticated logic for the strategies.


## Starting
Starting a project to automate stock buys and sells involves several steps. Here's a roadmap to guide you through the process:
  1. Define your Objectives
        - Determine your trading strategy (e.g., day trading, swing trading, long-term investing).
        - Specify the types of trades you want to automate (e.g., market orders, limit orders).
  2. Gather Requirements
        - API Access: Sign up for API access. Review the documentation for capabilities and limitations.
        - Programming Language: Choose a language (Python is recommended for its rich ecosystem and ease of use).
  3. Set up your Development Environment
        - Install Python: Download and install Python from python.org.
        - IDE/Editor: Choose an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebook.
        - Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries. You can start with:
                pip install requests pandas numpy
  4. Learn the Basics
        - APIs: Understand how RESTful APIs work. You can use online resources or courses to get a grasp on API interactions.
        - Trading Basics: Familiarize yourself with trading terminology and strategies if you haven't already.
  5. Authentication and API Calls
        - API Keys: get your API keys and tokens from API provider.
        - Authentication: Write code to authenticate and connect to the API.
        - API Requests: Learn how to make GET and POST requests to retrieve data and place orders.
  6. Write Basic Trading Funtions
        - Get Stock Data: Write functionst to get stock price data.
        - Place Orders: Write functions to place buy and sell orders.
  7. Develop your Trading Stategy
        - Algorithm: Develop and implement your trading algorithm. this could be based on technical indicators, fundamental analysis, or other criteria.
        - Backtesting: Test your strategy using histroical data to ensure its viability.
  8. Testing and Debugging
        - Sandbox Environment: If available, use a sandbox environment to test your code without risking real money.
        - Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging.
  9. Deploy and Monitory
        - Deployment: Once tested, deploy your trading bot. You can use cloud services like AWS, GCP, or a simple server.
        - Monitoring: Continuously monitor the performance of your tradin bot and make adjustments as needed.

## Example Steps in Code:
Step 1: Setting Up

#install necessary packages

pip install requests pandas


Step 2: Authentication Example

import requests

def authenticate():
    url = "https://api.fidelity.com/v1/authentication"
    payload = {
          'client_id': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
          'client_secret': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET',
          'grant_type': 'password',
          'username': 'YOUR_USERNAME',
          'password': 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
          }
