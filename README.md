# Stocks

##Steps to get started:
  1. Sign up for Trading Platform's API (Shwab): You need to register for access to their API. This will provide the necessary keys and tokens to interact with their systems programmatically.
  2. Choose a Programming Language (Python): Python is a popular choice for stock trading due to its extensive libraies and ease of use. Other languages like JavaScript, Java, or C# can also be used.
  3. Install Necessary Libraries: Fpr Python, you might use libraries like _requests_ for HTTO requests, _pandas_ for data manipulation, and _numpy_ for numerical operations.
  4. Authenticate: Use the credentials obtained from Fidelity to Authenticate your API requests.
  5. Make API Calls: Use the API to place, buy, and sell orders. API documentation wil have the details on the endpoints and data formats required.
  6. Handle Responses: Ensure your code properly handles the responses from Fidelity, including error handling and logging.

Here is a basic example in Python using the _requests_ library:

import requests
#Example endpoint, headers, and payload
url = "https://api.fidelity.com/v1/trading/orders"
headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
payload = {
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "quantity": 10,
        "action": "BUY", 
        "orderType": "LIMIT",
        "price": 150.00, 
        "duration": "DAY"
        }
response = requests.post(url, headers = hearders, json = payload)
if response.status_code == 200:
  print("Order placed successfully")
else:
  print(f"Failed to place order: {response.json()}")

This is just as simplified example. Need to adapt it based on the actual API specifications adn include proper error handling, logging, and perhaps more sophisticated logic for the strategies.
